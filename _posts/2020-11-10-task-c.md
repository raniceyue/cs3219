### Deliverables

Propose a possible microservices architecture for ChairVisE (or any
other project/existing software)

**LEARNING OBJECTIVE**  
To understand how a monolithic application can be
broken down into multiple microservices.

**MARKING SCHEME**
- Broad overview of architecture in diagram form: which feature sets are grouped together (1 marks)
- Rationale for proposed architecture (1 marks)
- High-level implementation detail e.g. communication interfaces, framework for each microservice (1 mark)

NB: If your project team is revamping ChairVisE3.0 with a microservices
architecture implementation, you should attempt this task with some other
software (new or existing). You will receive no credit if you attempt it with
ChairVisE3.0.

Submit a PDF document as proof of completion.
The document should contain the following information:
- Student Name and Matriculation Number.
- Microservices architecture overview diagram.
- Rationale for microservices architecture.
- High-level implementation details
